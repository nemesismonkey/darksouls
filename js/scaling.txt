I need help finding out the scaling numbers on the new weapons.
Below is all the information I think you would need to figure them out.
I managed to get the values on one but cant get it for the others.
Please help if you can.  Email me any results @  monkey@mugenmonkey.com
Thanks!


formula for damage

Physical Damage = Math.floor((PhyBASE  * (1+(str?*StrMod)+(dex?*DexMod)));
Magic Damage = Math.floor((MagBASE  * (1+(int?*IntMod)+(fth?*FthMod)));

PhyBASE = Base physical damage of the weapon
MagBASE = Base magic damage of the weapon
str?,dex?,int?,fth? are the respective scaling of each weapon and is the number i need.
The mods are the stats modifications.
your soul level for that stat and the number next to it are what you would use there
str and dex you would use physical
int and fth you would magic
weapons that are upgraded with twink titanite and have magic scaling use the umagic
humanity is for the chaos scaling

This calculates the final AR, if you need to just get the scaling ar just remove the 1+

I need the scaling factors for all upgrade paths for the two new weapons that are not special(pitch fork and gaurdian tail)
I managed to get the normal and crystal paths as a fluke for the pitchfork but am unable to figure out the others.
I also need the scaling for all the other special weapons, these are the ones that upgrade with twinkling
